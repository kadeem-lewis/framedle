- fuze.js for fuzzy search
- tailwindcss for styling
- react-aria for combobox?
- drizzle for db. Expo now supports drizzle so if I do have need for a db this will be my choice
- warframe has an api with a lot of data about the frames but it is missing a few details I might find interesting such as progenitor element, since
- expo.dev seems cool but using it means that I can't reuse a lot of the code that I did for pokedexle. it also means a lot of my favorite libraries won't work
- using expo does give me the chance to challenge myself, as well as learn react native
